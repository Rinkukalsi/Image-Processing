Image Processing Filters using OpenCV
This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates the application of different image processing filters using the OpenCV library. The program allows users to choose from various filters and apply them to an input image. It provides an interactive interface that displays the image with the selected filter in real-time.

Features
Apply three types of filters:

Gaussian Blur
Convert to Grayscale
Edge Detection (Canny)
Interactive user interface to choose and visualize filters.

Automatic reset of the image before applying a new filter.

Uses the OpenCV library for image processing and display.
